St8craft is a blockchain-based nation simulation and strategy game built on the Base network. Players create and govern nations, manage economies, develop infrastructure, engage in diplomacy, and wage war â€” all powered by a fully on-chain smart contract system written in Solidity. The game integrates Chainlink VRF for provable randomness, Chainlink Functions for off-chain computation, and a modular contract architecture for scalability. With mechanics for taxation, trade, military strategy, and political decision-making, St8craft combines deep strategy with the transparency and permanence of decentralized technology.
